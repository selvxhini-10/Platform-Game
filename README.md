# Hack-for-Humanity

## Inspiration
Plastic Pollution is an environmental crisis which has devastating impacts on marine life. Sea animals are killed every year after ingesting plastic or getting entangled in it, essentially destroying ocean ecosystems and marine diversity. We wanted to create an engaging and innovative way to address this issue. Inspired by platforms like Ocean Hero, which turns everyday web browsing into real-world cleanup efforts, we envisioned a game where player engagement directly contributes to ocean cleanup.

## What it does
Plastic Frenzy is an interactive video game that rewards players for progressing through challenges while simultaneously funding real-world plastic removal. By integrating a web scraping tool to display ads, every ad interaction generates revenue that goes toward ocean cleanup efforts. Players take on exciting missions to rid the ocean of virtual plastic, progressing through increasingly difficult levels while making a tangible environmental impact.

## How we built it
Game Development: Created using Unity & C# Scripts with engaging mechanics that simulate ocean cleanup. User Interface & Experience: Focused on creating a visually appealing, immersive experience that keeps players engaged. Web Scraping & Ad Integration: Implemented a tool to display ads, generating revenue for real-world plastic removal efforts.

## Challenges we ran into
Increasing each level's difficulty without making the game repetitive was challenging. We wanted to make sure the Player would stay interested and levels remained engaging. We had to brainstorm and add new challenges, mobs, and storylines to implement this. Integrating ad revenue in an effective way was another hurdle. We had to find an approach that didn’t disrupt the gameplay experience. Testing different ad formats and placements helped us optimize for both user experience and impact. We are still working on making advances to this feature– it's definitely the trickiest part.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating a platformer video game that is engaging but also addresses a global crisis. Designing the interactive experience and overcoming technical challenges was a very valuable experience overall.

## What we learned
We gained insight into the complexities of game development and useful strategies to maintain user engagement. We also learned about the potential of ad-based revenue models for funding social impact projects that allow users to balance entertainment with tangible impact.

## What's next for Plastic Frenzy
